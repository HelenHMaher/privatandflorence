        We met in May 2017 in Washington, DC. At the time, Privat was in
        graduate school for economics at Howard University, and Florence was
        working at the U.S. Department of State. In April 2018, Florence
        resigned from the Foreign Service after assignments in Mexico
        (2011-2013), Italy (2014-2016), and Washington, DC (2016-2018), the last
        of which included a memorable engagement in Honduras (fall 2017). Privat
        graduated around the same time, and we decided to come out west
        together. We spent the summer of 2018 living at Florence's maternal
        grandparents' family farm in Oregon, which will now acquire even more
        special meaning as the site of our wedding celebration.

        After that summer together at the farm, Florence left for Tokyo, Japan
        in fall 2018 to pursue a Master's degree thanks to a Rotary Peace
        Fellowship. While back in the U.S. for Thanksgiving 2018, we became
        engaged at my mother's home in Las Vegas, Nevada. Shortly thereafter,
        Privat returned to his home country, Gabon, to take up work as an
        economic consultant for the Gabonese government. For the past year, we
        have been surviving the Gabon-Japan long distance thanks to the miracle
        of modern telecommunications technology.

        Our wedding was originally planned to take place after Florence's
        anticipated graduation in the summer of 2020, but life, as it is wont to
        do, interveined. We made the decision to pushed our wedding back to 2021
        in order to avoid the health concerns and travel restrictions of the
        corona virus as much as possible and hope that you will be able to
        celebrate with us!
